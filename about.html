<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Newt, and I am currently a sophomore at IUPUI studying CIT.
    I am 22 years old and if astrology is your thing, I am a gemini.
    I was born and raised 30 minutes outside of Detroit, Michigan but moved to Indiana 6 years ago.
    Most of my friends and family think I am like a grandma because of my choice of hobbies.
    In my free time you will find me cooking or fermenting anything and everything.
    I also enjoy knitting, tending to my plants (I have over 60), puzzles, crosswords, and reading.</p>
