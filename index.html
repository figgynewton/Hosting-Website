<p>My favorite place in the world. I have been coming here since I was born. This picture features the Sleeping Bear Dunes which is a National Lakeshore overlooking Lake Michigan.
    The name Sleeping Bear Dunes comes from a Chippewa legend about a mother bear and her two cubs escaping a fire in Wisconsin's woods by swimming to the opposite side of Lake Michigan.
    The swim, however, was exhausting, and the cubs quickly fell behind their mother. The mother bear searched the shores of Michigan for her cubs, but they were too exhausted to complete the trek and perished just before reaching the shore.
    The mother then lay down and slept off, endlessly waiting for her kids. To memorialize the site where the cubs' trip ended, a spirit called as the Great Spirit Manitou constructed two islands — North and South Manitou islands —
    and then buried the mother with sand, forming the famed sand dunes.
